## Overview
<!-- Provide a high level overview of what this application is and why you are building it, beyond the fact that it's an assignment for a Code Fellows 301 class. (i.e. What's your problem domain?) -->
This application was created in order to utilize SQL queries in order to join data together in the database and access it based on specific criteria.

## Getting Started
