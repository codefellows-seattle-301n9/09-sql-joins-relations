# 09-sql-joins-relations

**Author**: Mitchell Hall, Ovidiu Parasca
**Version**: 1.0.0 

## Overview
* We are adding code to query a db (or create one if it doesn't exist), that has 2 tables (authors table, and articles table), and Join them together using a common key (aurhor_id)

## Getting Started
* We created a new branch, and cloned the repo locally.
* We installed the required frameworks (body-parse, express, fs, pg), and added the node_modules to the .gitignore file.
* We Started up our sql server and tested our .Get request
* After that we did the .Post and .Put request, we went through the testing in the CRUD-testing.md

## Architecture
* We used Postgresql, npm/nodemon, express, file system, body-parser, chrome and Postman

## Change Log
* 9:30am-10:24am - installed all the packages, updated the conString and committed our initial batch
* 1:30pm - committed to Git the .Post for query1,2,3
* 2:07pm - committed updated code for the .Get on joining the authors/articles tables
* 3:34pm - committed the .Put request code, and finalized testing
