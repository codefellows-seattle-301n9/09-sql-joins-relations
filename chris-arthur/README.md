**Version**: 1.0.0 (increment the patch/fix version number up if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview
<!-- Provide a high level overview of what this application is and why you are building it, beyond the fact that it's an assignment for a Code Fellows 301 class. (i.e. What's your problem domain?) -->
This application allows a user to view existing articles that are stored in database tables, as well as create a new article that will be stored in the updated database and displayed on the home page.

## Getting Started
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->
Initialize NPM project, install NPM packages (express, body-parser, pg, fs), and create new database with author and article tables. Write proper SQL queries to create, update, and delete records from the database tables.

## Architecture
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. -->

- HTML/CSS
- JavaScript/jQuery
- node.js/NPM
- SQL/PostgreSQL
